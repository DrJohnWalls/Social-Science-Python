Welcome to my guide for Practical Python Programming for Social Science Scholars!

Basic Instructions (once you've finished with the Handout):
1. Make a subfolder in the default Jupyter Notebook directory
2. Download each of the Workshop files and put them in that new folder (to download a file, left-click on it, then right-click on the Raw button on top, and finally left-click on the Save Link as.. menu option)
3. Download the necessary_files.zip file as well, unzip the files and put them in that new folder as well
4. Take a look at the Workshop 1 (you can only access it from within Jupyter Notebook)

Below, you'll see some of the best links for learning about Python:
