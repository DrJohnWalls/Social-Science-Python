Welcome to my guide for Practical Python Programming for Social Science Scholars!

Grasp the Basics (once you've finished with the Handout):
1. Go to [Computer Science Circles](http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/) and do all their lessons
2. Read through [Handling Errors](http://i.imgur.com/WRuJV6r.png)
3. If you ever have problems with the syntax, check out [TutorialsPoint Python](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/) 
4. Read through a few chapters of the Python for Biologists blog (yes, obviously we're not biologists, but their guide is excellent for those outside the field of computer science):
 --1. [Printing and Manipulating Text](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/introduction-to-python-for-biologists/2-printing-and-manipulating-text/)
 --2. [Reading and Writing to Files](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/introduction-to-python-for-biologists/reading-and-writing-files/)
 --3. [Lists and Loops](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/introduction-to-python-for-biologists/lists-and-loops/)
 --4. [Conditions](http://pythonforbiologists.com/index.php/introduction-to-python-for-biologists/conditions/)

Next Steps (my guide):
1. Make a subfolder in the default Jupyter Notebook directory
2. Download each of the Workshop files and put them in that new folder (to download a file, left-click on it, then right-click on the Raw button on top, and finally left-click on the Save Link as.. menu option)
3. Download the necessary_files.zip file as well, unzip the files and put them in that new folder as well
4. Take a look at the Workshop 1 (you can only access it from within Jupyter Notebook)
